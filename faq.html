        "text": "A midi dress is a dress with a hemline that falls between the knee and ankle, typically hitting at mid-calf. The term 'midi' comes from 'mid-calf,' and the length generally measures 26 to 30 inches from the natural waistline depending on height. This places the hem approximately 2 to 4 inches below the knee for average heights (5'4\" to 5'7\"). The midi length works for both casual and formal occasions, offering more coverage than mini dresses while providing easier movement than floor-length options. This versatility has made midi dresses increasingly popular, with sales data showing they now represent approximately 35% of all dress purchases compared to just 18% in 2015."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Midi dress styling depends primarily on the occasion and fabric. For professional settings, pair a structured midi dress with closed-toe pumps (2.5 to 3-inch heels work best with midi lengths) and a tailored blazer, keeping accessories minimal with stud earrings and a simple watch. For casual wear, style your midi with white sneakers or flat sandals, adding a denim jacket and crossbody bag for a relaxed look. Evening styling calls for heeled sandals or pointed-toe pumps, statement jewelry, and a clutch. The key proportion rule: if your midi dress is loose or flowing, balance it with more fitted accessories and shoes; if the dress is fitted, you can add volume through jackets or bags. Adding a belt at the natural waistline creates definition and can adjust the perceived length by raising the visual break point."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Midi dresses flatter most body types when you select the appropriate cut and fit. A-line midi dresses work exceptionally well for pear shapes (hips wider than shoulders) by skimming over the hip area without clinging while the fitted bodice balances proportions. Hourglass figures benefit from wrap styles or belted options that emphasize the natural waistline. Empire waist midi dresses suit apple shapes (weight carried in the midsection) by creating a high waistline just below the bust, then flowing over the stomach area. Rectangle or athletic builds gain curves from fit-and-flare styles or dresses with ruffle details that add dimension. Petite frames (under 5'4\") should look for midi dresses that hit at the slimmest part of the calf and avoid heavy fabrics that overwhelm smaller frames. Tall frames (over 5'9\") can wear any midi style but may need to size up or seek tall-specific lines, as standard midi lengths may hit awkwardly at the widest part of the calf."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Yes, midi dresses are appropriate for most weddings, particularly daytime, garden, and semi-formal celebrations. Choose fabrics and colors that match the formality level: satin or silk midi dresses in jewel tones or navy work for evening weddings, while floral or pastel midi dresses suit daytime spring and summer ceremonies. Avoid white, cream, or ivory unless explicitly requested by the couple, and steer clear of black for daytime weddings unless the invitation specifies cocktail or formal attire. For beach weddings, linen or cotton midi dresses in bright colors work well, while formal evening weddings call for structured midi dresses in luxe fabrics with elegant accessories. The midi length is particularly practical for outdoor weddings where floor-length gowns might drag through grass or sand. According to wedding etiquette experts, midi dresses now account for approximately 40% of female guest attire at non-black-tie weddings."

        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Choose based on the occasion, season, and desired aesthetic. Linen midi dresses excel for casual daytime events, warm weather (above 70°F), and relaxed settings like brunches, farmers markets, or beach vacations. Linen breathes exceptionally well, wicks moisture, and gets softer with each wash, though it wrinkles easily—which many consider part of its casual charm. Expect to pay $50-$140 for quality linen midi dresses. Satin midi dresses serve formal occasions, evening events, and cooler weather. The glossy finish photographs beautifully and creates an elevated, polished appearance suitable for cocktail parties, formal dinners, or date nights. Satin shows every wrinkle and body line, so it typically includes lining and strategic seaming. Polyester satin ($80-$150) offers easier care than silk satin ($200-$400) with similar visual impact. If you need one versatile option, choose a structured cotton or crepe midi dress that bridges both casual and semi-formal occasions."

      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Shoe selection for midi dresses follows specific proportion guidelines. Heeled sandals or pumps (2 to 4 inches) create the most elongating effect, as they add height while the midi length shows enough leg to maintain balance. Nude or metallic shoes extend the leg line most effectively. For casual styling, white leather sneakers, flat sandals, or loafers work well, though they create a more relaxed silhouette. Avoid ankle boots with midi dresses unless you have a tall frame (over 5'8\"), as the combination creates a visual break at the calf that can shorten your appearance. Knee-high boots can work in fall and winter if the dress fabric is fitted rather than voluminous. The most universally flattering combination pairs a fitted or A-line midi dress with heels that match your skin tone or the dress color, creating an unbroken vertical line that elongates the frame."

        "text": "Proper midi dress fit depends on the style, but general guidelines apply across types. The shoulder seams should sit at the edge of your shoulders, not drooping down your arms or pulling across your back. The bust area should lie smooth without gaping or straining—if you see pulling or wrinkles radiating from buttons or closures, size up. The waist should skim your natural waistline without digging in; you should be able to fit two fingers comfortably between the dress and your body. For the skirt portion, you should be able to walk with a normal stride—if you're taking shortened steps, the dress is too narrow. The hem should hit at the slimmest part of your calf, typically 2 to 4 inches below the knee, though this varies by height. If you're between sizes, size up for wrap styles and fitted cuts, but stick with your usual size for A-line and loose styles. Quality midi dresses include 5-8% spandex or elastane for comfortable movement throughout the day."

        "text": "Care requirements vary significantly by fabric. Linen midi dresses can typically be machine washed in cold water on gentle cycles, then air dried or tumble dried on low heat—though air drying reduces shrinkage risk. Iron linen while slightly damp using high heat for a crisp look, or embrace the natural wrinkles for casual wear. Satin midi dresses usually require more delicate care: polyester satin can often be machine washed on delicate cycles in cold water inside a mesh bag, then hung to dry, while silk satin needs dry cleaning or hand washing in cold water with gentle detergent. Never wring satin—roll it in a towel to remove excess water. Cotton and cotton-blend midi dresses are the most forgiving, tolerating machine washing and drying, though removing them while slightly damp and hanging to finish drying prevents excessive wrinkling. For ruffle midi dresses or styles with embellishments, always check care labels, as decorative elements often require gentler handling than the base fabric. Store midi dresses on hangers rather than folded to maintain their shape and minimize wrinkles."
